--feature maps == channels
better to have many channels

--convolutional layers 
combine input tensors with kernel tensors (and a scalar bias) to produce output tensor

--padding
using cross-correlation with a convolutional kernel (K) reduces size of image (X) to
(Xw - Kw + 1, Xh - Kh + 1). Only a number of convolutions can then be applied. Padding 
solves this problem

--strides
when we want to move filter more than 1px at a time. Can define different values for horizontal
and vertical traversal. Prevents learning redundant features and helps with downsampling greatly.
Bigger strides, quicker traversal over picture, but captures less detail. (bigger strides for MRI?)
